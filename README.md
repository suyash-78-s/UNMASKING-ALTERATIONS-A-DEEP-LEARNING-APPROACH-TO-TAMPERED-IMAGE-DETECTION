Unmasking Alterations: A Deep Learning Approach to Tampered Image Detection
This project focuses on detecting tampered images using Error Level Analysis (ELA) and a deep learning model (ResNet50). By combining preprocessing with advanced machine learning, the system classifies images as real or tampered.

Performance:
Accuracy: 94.88% on test data.
Confusion Matrix: Highlights strong classification capability.

Technologies
ELA: Amplifies tampered regions.
Keras/TensorFlow: For model implementation.
NumPy/Pandas: For data handling.
OpenCV: Assists in image preprocessing.
