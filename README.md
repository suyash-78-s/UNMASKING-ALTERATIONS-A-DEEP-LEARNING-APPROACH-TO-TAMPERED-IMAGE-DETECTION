Unmasking Alterations: A Deep Learning Approach to Tampered Image Detection
This project focuses on detecting tampered images using Error Level Analysis (ELA) and a deep learning model (ResNet50). By combining preprocessing with advanced machine learning, the system classifies images as real or tampered.
